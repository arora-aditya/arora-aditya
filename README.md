### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer and Data Scientist based in Waterloo, Canada. Over the winter, I worked at [Wish](https://wish.com) as a Data Scientist on the Consumer Data Team. In the Summmer of 2020, I worked at [Wish](https://wish.com) as a Software Engineer on the Product Payments Team. In my free time, I've helped start a design agency [Sage Co](https://thesage.co) to help develop websites and brand identities for small businesses.

I have previously worked as a Software Engineer at [KitchenMate](https://kitchenmate.com) doing Full Stack, Data Science and Embedded Systems, as a Data and Backend Engineer at [DraperAI](https://draper.ai) building smart tools for Amazon Ads and as an Undergraduate Research Assistant under Prof. Fakhri Karray to build intelligents bot for customers at Canada's most popular grocery chain to make it easier to find what they need.

Eight months out of twelve, I study Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo, and graduate in early 2022.

I'm always looking for my next opportunity, so feel free to reach out to me if you want to chat or have any questions!
