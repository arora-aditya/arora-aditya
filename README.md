### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer and Data Scientist based in Waterloo, Canada. Over the past 2 years I've spent all my coops at [Wish](https://wish.com) first as a Software Engineer on the Payments team and then as a Data Scientist on the Consumer Data Team. In my free time, I've helped start a design agency [Sage Co](https://thesage.co) to help develop websites and brand identities for small businesses.

I have previously worked as a Software Engineer at [KitchenMate](https://kitchenmate.com) doing Full Stack, Data Science and Embedded Systems, as a Data and Backend Engineer at [DraperAI](https://draper.ai) building smart tools for Amazon Ads and as an Undergraduate Research Assistant under Prof. Fakhri Karray to bring NLP chatbots to production and also under Prof. Derek Wright to build a platform for the ECE department to manage accreditation requirements.

Eight months out of twelve, I study Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo, and graduate in early 2022.

Outside of work I like to [read](https://arora-aditya.com/reading), [write](https://blogs.arora-aditya.com/) and listen to [music](https://open.spotify.com/user/arora_aditya)

I'm always looking for my next opportunity, so feel free to reach out to me if you want to chat or have any questions!
