### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Developer based in Waterloo, Canada. Currently I work at [Wish](https://wish.com) as a Software Developer on the Product Payments Team. In my free time, I help run a design agency [Sage Co](https://thesage.co) to help develop websites and brand identities for small businesses.

I have previously worked as a Software Engineer at KitchenMate doing Data Science and Embedded Systems, as a Data Engineer at DraperAI building smart tools for Amazon Ads and as an Undergraduate Research Assistant under Prof. Fakhri Karray to build intelligents bot for customers at Canada's most popular grocery chain to make it easier to find what they need.

Eight months out of twelve, I study Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo, and expect to graduate early 2022.

I'm always looking for my next opportunity, so feel free to reach out to me if you want to chat or have any questions!
